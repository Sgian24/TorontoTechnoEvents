# Toronto Techno Events

Web app I developed to browse upcoming techno events in Toronto. Users can filter through events based on venues and/or dates. Google Maps integration
also lets users browse events by location. Resource is fetched from a Firebase Firestore database that stores data curled from the "Real-Time Events Search" API.

Tools Used:

* React
* Firebase Firestore
* Bootstrap
* React Router
* Google Maps API
* React Datepicker
